Change Log
==========
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

v1.03 - 2025-05-11 - VMLC-PV
------------------------------------
- JV_steady_state.py, hysteresis.py, impedance.py, imps.py, EQE.py, CV.py: Added verbose output option for simulation functions made sure that we only return an integer (return code) and a message (string) from the simulation functions. This is to ensure that the return value is always an integer, never an object.
- general.py: remade the 'error_message' function to provide more informative error messages and implemented an error code 666 when multiple simulations ran in parallel failed with different error messages.
- parallel_sim.py: made the parallel output consitent between linux and windows. Improved error message when error code 91 is returned to make it easier to find which input parameters caused the error.
- JV_sweep.py: added a new experiment to perform single sweep JV simulations using zimt.


v1.02 - 2025-04-28 - VMLC-PV, SH, FE
------------------------------------
- general.py: Modified the construct_cmd to work on Windows by adding "" around the parameter names and values.
- Impedance.py: Let the function 'run_impedance_simu' return a result and message. With this update, 'result' is always a number, never an object. Handle failed to converge Voc simulation.
- Hysteresis.py: removed np.trapezoid and replaced it with scipy.integrate.trapezoid, small update to the message output.
- addons.py: Added some very simple functions to calculate the performance metrics of the solar cell. 
- get_SIMsalabim.py: fix some indentation issues.
- Removed redundant SIMsalabim folder.
- update docs.


v1.01 - 18-02-2025 - SH
------------------------
- Impedance.py: If the tolerance of the density solver (tolDens) was not strict enough when doing impedance, the calculated spectrum could be wrong/incorrect in some cases due to not high enough accuracy. As a small delta t creates a very large spike in current, we need sufficient accuracy to resolve this, hence the tolerance must be strict enough. We added a function to calculate the tolerance of the density solver to ensure that it is sufficiently strict. It is calculated using tolDens = J(t=âˆž) - J(t=0) / J_displacement.
- Impedance.py: Added the option to calculate impedance at open-circuit voltage (Set applied voltage *V<sub>0</sub>* to 'oc'). When set, first the Voc is calculated by SIMsalabim, after which the just calculated Voc is then used as the applied voltage for the impedance calculation.
- Hysteresis.py: Included the calculation of the hysteresis index (HI). The HI is defined as the area between the forward and backward scan normalised over the spanned area of the curves.


v1 - 2024-10-16 - VMLC-PV
--------------------------
- Initial release of the project.
- Includes new test and documentation.
- added varFile as an input for the experiment functions.
- added turn_off_autoTidy as a kwargs for the experiment functions to avoid autoTidy when not using threadsafe functions.
- created setup.py and requirements.txt files.
